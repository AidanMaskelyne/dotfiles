## Linear Data Structures:
- Arrays
- Lists
	- Tuples
	- Linked Lists
- Records
- Stacks
- Queues
- Hash tables

## Non Linear Data Structures:
- Tree
- Graph

## Pseudocode for records:
``` C++
// Pseudocode to declare record structure
record student
	studentNum: Integer
	favSubject: String
endrecord

// Pseudocode to create a record
PennyLane : student
PennyLane.studentNum = 71454
PennyLane.favSubject = "Computer Science"
```

# In Depth:

## Lists:
- A collection of data items in a sequence without any gaps (unlike arrays)
- Accessed via index (like arrays) starting at 0
- Data items can be inserted or deleted at any point in the list
- Can hold different data types
- Lists are dynamic (not fixed/static) and can gow and shrink as required
